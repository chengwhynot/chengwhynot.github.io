## 4 types of proposal

internal, external; solicited and unsolicited. These can come to 4 types.

## Ethics of proposal

1. Be honest about budgets, timelines and deliverables.
2. Never propose works that other people will have to do.
3. Respect the chain of command in your company.
4. Be mindful of how/what you're proposing will impact other people.
5. Be tactful when describing problems or missed opportunities.

## Understanding the context and strategy of your proposal

### Context

**Context** All the things that surround any form of communication, or might influence that communication.

**Persona** A series of strategic, communication-based decisions about how you'll appear in your writing.

The Rhetorical Triangle, Author, Audience, Purpose.

What should we be? Who are your audience.

Three basic goals: to Inform, to persuade, to emotionally move.

### Argument

To persuade, there highly will be an argument, to have an argument, you must have claim first.

#### Elements of argument

**Claim** The main thing that an argument is trying to prove.

**Evidence** The facts, physical evidence, observational evidence, statistical evidence, anecdotal evidence and common sense, sometimes, research based evidence will also counts.

**Reasons** The abstract logic or intuitive leaps connecting the evidence to the claim.

**Counterargument** The inclusion of a perspective that might disagree with your own.

**Rebuttal** Your reponse to the contrary viewpoint found in the counterargument.

Counterargument and rebuttal can make your proposal more creditable, not less.

### Appealing to your audience

3 classic appeals: ethos, logos and pathos.

**Ethos**-Appeal to character, is the characters you appeal to your audience, the passioner, the thinker, the aggressive action taker or somebody else?

**Logos**-Appeal to logic; support based on facts, evidence and etc.

**Pathos**-Appeal to emotion. Shared values or beliefs. When you talking about moving a reader emotionaly, trying to get them engage, that is talking about pathos.

Appeals | Answer questions
--- | ---
Ethos | Why should I **listen** to you?
Logos | What **proof** do you have?
Pathos | Why should I **care**?

### Questions to ask yourself

Ask these questions when writing a proposal.

1. What kind of persona will I create?
1. What can I assume about my reader's expertise, attitudes, and needs? How will I use those assumptions?
1. At what points do I need to inform, persuade, or emtionally move readers?
1. What are my main claims? How many things will I need to prove?
1. What is my most compelling evidence? Have I gathered ALL possible evidence?
1. What reasons connect my evidence to my claim? Do they logically demonstrate the sufficiency or appropriateness of my evidence?
1. Have I considered and responded to counterarguments with a reasonable rebuttal?
1. What combination of appeals will I use? Ethical, logical or emotional appeals?

### Header and Title

A typical memo's header has "To, From, Subject and Date", 4 parts.

To and From are better using full name with title. If there're mulitple people, order them by rank, then in the alphabet order, if there're more people with same rank.

Subject will formlize by kind of *Document*, main *benefit* and primary *deliverable*, such as "A proposal to Increase Data Integrity by Standardizing Back-Up Policies on Servers and Workstations PCs".

Date are better spell out month, such as May 3, 2019. And use the date **submitted**, not the date written.

If you write a formal proposal, like a proposal to outside one, you may like to have a title page.

### Purpose Statement

Very very brief and precise of what the proposal does.

> Sample Purpose Statement
>
> "The purpose of this document is to propose that we standardize out data backup techniques on both the individual and corporate level.
> Taking these measures will safeguard against future data loss and help ensure continuing uniterrupted operations."

What doest that mean? It has 3 elements.

1. A problem or opportunity exists.

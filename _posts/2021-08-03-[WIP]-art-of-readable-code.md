## Summary

The single theme for this chapter is: pack information into your names. By this, we mean
that the reader can extract a lot of information just from reading the name.

Here are some specific tips we covered:
. Use specific words—for example, instead of Get, words like Fetch or Download might be
better, depending on the context.
. Avoid generic names like tmp and retval, unless there’s a specific reason to use them.
. Use concrete names that describe things in more detail—the name ServerCanStart() is vague compared to CanListenOnPort().
. Attach important details to variable names—for example, append _ms to a variable whose value is in milliseconds or prepend raw_ to an unprocessed variable that needs
escaping.
. Use longer names for larger scopes—don’t use cryptic one- or two-letter names for variables that span multiple screens; shorter names are better for variables that span only a few lines.
. Use capitalization, underscores, and so on in a meaningful way—for example, you can append “_” to class members to distinguish them from local variables.

Most teams don’t finish everything they plan to finish every iteration. Management, or even Scrum Masters, tend to respond by asking teams to plan better during their sprint planning meetings.
大部分团队在迭代结束时，并不能做完计划会议上定下的所有事项。管理者，甚至敏捷教练，总是倾向让团队在下次迭代计划会议室做得更好一些。  

This is often the wrong response.
其实这通常并不是一个正确的做法。  

## Why Teams Can’t Plan Sprints Perfectly
## 为什么团队不能做出完美计划

Not everything is predictable. The team may be interrupted more, or less, during the sprint than they anticipated during the sprint planning meeting.
并不是所有事情都可以预见。团队或多或少的，都会在迭代过程中做更多或者其它的一些事情，这些事情计划会议上并不会显现出来。

Similarly, a team cannot perfectly anticipate every task that will be needed. They may fail to identify some tasks that are necessary or they may identify tasks that turn out not to be needed.
同理，团队也不能完美的预见到每一项任务。他们也许未能识别出必需的任务，或者过多的识别出任务。

For example, after I write the first draft of this blog post, I will send it to my editor and she’ll return it to me to review her edits. I estimate we’ll need one round of edits and revisions. But sometimes my first draft really sucks, and we need two (or more) rounds of edits and revisions.

举个例子，当我写这篇博文的初稿时，我会把它寄给我的编辑，然后她会把她的评审再发给我。

I typically plan on one round of edits because that is normally enough. But that means I sometimes am missing tasks from my blog writing plan. However, if I planned for two rounds of edits for every blog post, I would sometimes have identified unnecessary tasks.

我和编辑一般只进行一轮的沟通修改，通常就够了。这也意味着，有时候我会做的不够。然而，如果我为每一篇博文进行两轮修改，我会发现我会做一些无用的工作。

It seems I just can’t get it right.

看起来无论怎么样都做不对。

## The Problem with Thinking Harder

## 想得更多的问题

Neither can your team. No matter how often or stridently team members are told to “think of everything,” they can’t.、

团队永远也不可能。不管他们多频繁或者多努力的被告知去“全面考虑”，他们就是做不到。

The good news: They don’t need to.

好消息是，他们也不需要做到。

## What to Do in Sprint Planning Meetings Instead

## 那么计划会议上我们需要做什么

Instead of attempting the impossible and trying to identify and estimate every task that will be done in a sprint, the team should instead quickly identify only the main tasks.

与其做无谓试图去识别和评估冲刺过程中所有可能的任务，团队更应该快速定位那些主要的核心任务。

Think about this way: Suppose you are planning your first trip to France. Paris will, of course, be one of your stops. But you also want to visit Nice, Cannes, Marseille, and others. How many days should you spend in Paris?

不如这样去做：假设你正在计划你的第一次法国之旅。巴黎，无可争议的，是需要停留一次的。但是你同时还想参观尼斯，戛纳，马赛等等其他城市。那么你需要在巴黎待几天呢？

You don’t need to map out a complete hour-by-hour itinerary to decide how much time to spend in Paris. Making a rough list of the most important things you want to see or do in Paris would help you decide whether five or seven days is best, considering all else you want to do on your trip.

你不需要计划出一份完整的，到小时的需要在巴黎待多久。只是制定一个粗略的、重要的清单，包含巴黎那些你想去地方的或者想做的事情，这样就会确定下来在巴黎待五天还是七天，其他地方也是一样计划出来。

It’s the same for an agile team during its sprint planning meeting. Identifying the major tasks necessary to get done is sufficient for deciding how many and which product backlog items can be brought into the sprint.

对于团队的计划会议也是同样道理。找出主要任务，然后就能识别出做多少和做哪些产品待办列表里面的东西。

## Target Identifying About Two Thirds

## 目标是2/3

In my experience, good agile teams can successfully do sprint planning by targeting about two-thirds of the tasks that will ultimately be completed during the sprint.

我过去的经验告诉我，良好的敏捷团队在计划会议时，能够成功的找到2/3的任务。

I want to be really clear about that: I’m not saying they plan about two-thirds of their available time. I said they identify about two-thirds of the tasks they’ll ultimately do. Those would be things like

让我更明确的说一下：我不是说团队只需要计划占三分之二他们工作时间。我是说识别出来2/3他们最终能做得事情，比如：

- Code this (crucial) thing
- Test that (crucial) thing
- Update the design based on user feedback
- Meet with key stakeholders about some topic
- Add this field to the report
- 编码这个
- 测试那个
- 根据用户反馈更新设计
- 与stakeholders讨论某个话题
- 在报告中加上某项内容

For example, if a team will ultimately complete 60 bits of work during an iteration, identifying 40 of them during the sprint planning is sufficient for a well-planned sprint.

再举个例子，如果一个团队在迭代中最终能够完成60比特的工作，那么在计划会议上定义出来40bit的话，就是一个很好的计划会议了。

Returning to our Parisian holiday, identifying 8 of the 12 things we’ll ultimately do in Paris would be enough.

回到我们的巴黎之旅，能够找出来12个事情的8个的话，就够了。

It’s worth repeating that the items identified should be the main, bigger, and more easily identified activities. That means that identifying two-thirds of the tasks may represent 80–90 percent of a team’s available working time during a sprint.

再强调一遍，我们需要找出来的是那些主要的，大的，更容易识别出来的活动。这意味着这些找出来的占总量2/3的任务，会在冲刺过程中，占到团队80%-90%的工作时间。

## How Many Tasks Should a Team Do in a Sprint?

一个冲刺中需要有多少个任务？

Let’s turn the vague advice of identifying two-thirds of a team’s tasks into something more directly usable.



To do that, imagine how wonderful life would be if every day every team member said in the daily scrum, “Yesterday I did exactly this one thing and today I’ll do exactly that other one thing.”

Life would be wonderful if every day every team member finished exactly one task. For example, a six-person team running a ten-day (two-week) iteration would complete 60 tasks (6x10).

That means in this example, team members would target identifying around 40 of their eventual 60 tasks. The remaining tasks will be identified naturally during the sprint.

## Don’t Plan Every Detail During Sprint Planning Meetings

If you follow this advice, team members probably will not plan as many tasks as they are accustomed to doing during the sprint planning meeting. So the sprint may seem less full at first. But the reality is, it won’t be.

Returning to our holiday, identifying only the main things you’ll do in Paris doesn’t mean you’ll be sitting on the Champs-Élysées twiddling your thumbs with nothing to do for the last two days of your trip.

Rather, you’ve identified the main activities of your holiday, knowing that once in Paris you’ll find plenty of additional things to joyfully fill any unplanned time.

The same is true for a team that identifies only the main activities of a sprint. Unplanned time will be filled with the smaller tasks that are best identified during the sprint.

## The Advantage

The advantage of working this way is that sprint planning meetings can be done more quickly with less frustration and no loss of accuracy in planning the sprint.

I wrote a book on [estimating and planning](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/agile-estimating-and-planning). Trust me: if anyone in the world wants to be in a planning meeting, it’s probably me.

Yet far more I find myself coaching a team to spend *less* time in its sprint planning meetings rather than more.

All too often, team members become obsessed with trying to identify every last thing they’ll do in a sprint. You don’t need to know you’ll sip coffee at the Café de Flore on Thursday from 11:00 – 11:25 to plan your trip to Paris.

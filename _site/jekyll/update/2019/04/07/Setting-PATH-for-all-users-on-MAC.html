<h1 id="setting-path-for-all-users-on-mac">Setting PATH for all users on MAC</h1>

<p>When I setting up my old mac laptop for Ruby and Jekyll, I hit an issue:</p>

<p>after running</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install bundle jekyll</code></p>

<p>I tried</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll new my-owesome-site</code>, but jekyll is not command. Obviousely missing folders in PATH.</p>

<p>‘export’ only works for current session, we need to find a way to change PATH permanently. Google <a href="https://blog.just2us.com/2011/05/setting-path-variable-in-mac-permanently/">this article</a>, I choose change PATH for all users. The commands are list below.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo pico /etc/paths</code></p>

<p>add <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin/</code> to first line in that file, maybe you need to change ‘~’ with your account’s home folder.</p>

<p>That’s it! Now jekyll -v will find right path to run!</p>
